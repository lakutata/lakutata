# Third-party notices

Parts of `@lakutata/utils` are derived from the third-party projects listed below. They are rewritten in TypeScript and
modified; the original copyright notices and license terms are reproduced here as required.

## @hapi/hoek 11.0.7

The deep clone of `CloneDeep`: `src/lib/helpers/CloneDeep.ts`, from `lib/clone.js`.

Modifications: rewritten in TypeScript, with the default options of the upstream clone only (the prototypes and the
symbol properties are kept, no shallow paths); the binary data (typed arrays, data views, array buffers) and the boxed
primitives are cloned by their constructors.

## fast-xml-parser 4.5.3

The validation of the XML documents of `IsXML`: `src/lib/helpers/internal/XMLValidator.ts`, from `src/validator.js` and
`src/util.js`.

Modifications: rewritten in TypeScript, with the boolean attributes allowed and no unpaired tag, giving whether the
document is valid without computing the errors and their positions; a self closing root element closes the root (a
text or an element after it is invalid), and an XML declaration is invalid anywhere but at the start of the document.

## @msgpack/msgpack 3.1.3

The encoding and the decoding of `MessagePack`: `src/lib/helpers/internal/msgpack`, from `src/Encoder.ts`,
`src/Decoder.ts`, `src/CachedKeyDecoder.ts`, `src/timestamp.ts`, `src/ExtData.ts`, `src/DecodeError.ts` and `src/utils`.

Modifications: rewritten with the options of `MessagePack` (int 64 as bigints, the properties of undefined value
ignored, the dates as timestamps) instead of the options and the extension codecs, one value decoded synchronously
(no stream); the encoder and the decoder are reused.

## object-hash 3.0.0

`ObjectHash`: `src/lib/helpers/ObjectHash.ts`, from `index.js`.

Modifications: rewritten in TypeScript (the serializers of the types as methods of a class, the streaming API not
ported).
